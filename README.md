### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-css-animations from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-css-animations
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo css-animations
```

### After installing and initiate 

After installing and initiate the generator you can choose which preprocessor you want to generate.
The genearator automatically installs all packages you need. After this process you have to run
```bash
grunt
```
Then the stylesheet will be created.

As source code you need an SCSS stylesheet.
As target code you can get LESS, CSS or Stylus.
